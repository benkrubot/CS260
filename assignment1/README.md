# Marbles Project

I think that the marbles would be represented by integers, and the bag could be represented by an array. Currently I coded the project to just basically have a running count of what is in bag e.g. bag = 0 and if they choose to add 12 then bag = 12. If we were to use an array, we could have an add and remove method that can add or remove the integer added. We could use the std::find to search the array for the element and position to be removed As for tests, we could start with an empty bag, add a few known values, then pull out the values and check if they are being removed.

Also, not sure what a driver file is supposed to be. Is it just the .exe file that is compiled or is it a separate .cpp file that I need to code?
